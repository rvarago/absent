# absent

A simple library to compose nullable types in a declarative style for the modern C++ programmer.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rvarago/absent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rvarago/absent)

## Description

Handling nullable types has always been forcing us to add a significant amount of boilerplate in our code, in such a
way that it sometimes even hides the business logic which we are trying to express in our code.

Consider an API that makes use of nullable types, such as std::optional<A>. We may have the following functions:

```
std::optional<person> find_person() const;
std::optional<address> find_address(person const&) const;
zip zip_code(address const&) const;
```

A fairly common pattern in C++ would then be:

```
auto const maybe_person = find_person();
if (!maybe_person) return;

auto const maybe_address = find_address(*maybe_person);
if (!maybe_address) return;

auto const zip_code = zip_code(*maybe_address);
```

We have mixed business logic with error handling, it'd be nice to have these two concerns apart from each other. It's a lot
of boilerplate to achieve such a simple requirement as obtaining the zip code of a given person.

Now, compare it against the code that does not make use of nullable types whatsoever. And of course, it expects
that nothing can fail:

```
auto const zip_code = zip_code(find_address(find_person()));
```

Which is simpler to read and therefore understand.

The problem here is that the introduction of nullable types breaks our ability to compose the code by chaining
elementary operations. We have to find a way to combine the type-safety of nullable types together with the
expressiveness achieved by composing simple functions as we do for the non-nullable types.

### Enters _absent_

_absent_ provides simple abstractions based on functional programming to help us composing operations. It's inspired by
Haskell and so uses a similar vocabulary. It does **NOT** attempt to solve all problems, far away from it.
However, it abstracts away some details by encapsulating common patterns into functions, giving labels to repetitive pieces
of logic. Therefore, it reduces the syntactic noise of some forms of composition of nullable types.

It's important to say: _absent_ does **NOT** provide any implementation of nullable types, but it attempts to wrap the
ones that you're using.

Hence, an interesting caveat of _absent_ is that:

> _absent_ is agnostic regarding the concrete implementation of a nullable type that you're using, 
as long as it adheres to the concept of a nullable type expected by the library.

Mainly:

* It has to have a type parameter.
* It has to be default constructible in order to express an empty state.

And to work out of the box, it has to have the following properties:

* It has to be convertible to bool in order to check the absence of a value.
* It has to support the de-reference operation to extract the contained value.

However, these last two requirements can be adapted by providing template specializations.
See ```absent/syntax/nullable.h``` for more details, and ```test/customnullable_test.cpp``` for an example.

One example of a nullable type that models this concept would obviously then be: _std::optional_, which, by the way, is going to
have a nice [monadic interface](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p0798r3.html) soon.

Meanwhile, _absent_ may be used to fill that gap. And even after it could still be interesting, since it's agnostic
regarding the concrete nullable types, also working for optional-like types other than _std::optional_.

### Getting started

_absent_ is packaged as a header-only library and, once installed, to get started with it you simply have to include the
main header _absent/absent.h_, which includes all the combinators. Or you can include each combinator as you need them,
for example, _absent/combinators/fmap.h_.

You can find all the combinators inside the namespace _rvarago::absent_.

Since the qualified names may be too verbose, an alias might be helpful.

### Rewriting the person/address/zip_code example using absent

Using a prefix notation, we can rewrite the above example using _absent_ as:

```
auto const maybe_zip_code = fmap(bind(find_person(), find_address), zip_code);
````

Or using the infix notation based on overloaded operators:

```
auto const maybe_zip_code = find_person() >> find_address | zip_code;
````

Almost as easy to read as the version without using nullable types, but with the expressiveness and type-safety
brought by them.

In the case where _find_address_ and _zip_code_ are "getter" member functions, such as:

```
std::optional<address> person::find_address() const;
zip address::zip_code() const;
```

It's possible to wrap them inside lambdas and use _fmap_ and _bind_ as we did before.

However, overloads that accept getter member functions are also provided to simplify the caller code even more.

So, using the infix notation, we can do:

```
auto const maybe_zip_code = find_person() >> &person::find_address | &address::zip_code;
if (maybe_zip_code) {
    // You just have to check at the end before making the "final" use of the outcome yielded by the composition chain
}
````

To understand the above snippets, here it follows a brief explanation of the combinators _fmap_ and _bind_.

#### fmap (|)

One of the most basic and useful operations to allow the composition of nullable types is _fmap_. Which roughly
speaking turns a nullable type containing a value of type _A_ into a functor.
 
Given a nullable _N[A]_ and a function _f: A -> B_, _fmap_ uses _f_ to map over _N[A]_, yielding another nullable
_N[B]_.

Furthermore, if the input nullable is empty, _fmap_ does nothing, and simply returns a brand new empty nullable _N[B]_.

Example:

```
auto int_to_string = [](auto const& a){ return std::to_string(a); };
std::optional<int> const one{1};
std::optional<std::string> const one_as_string = fmap(one, int_to_string); // contains "1"
std::optional<int> const none{};
std::optional<std::string> const empty_as_string = fmap(none, int_to_string); // contains nothing
```

To simplify the act of chaining multiple operations, an infix notation of _fmap_ is provided via overloading _operator|_:

```
auto const string2int = [](auto const& a){ return std::stoi(a); };
auto const int2string = [](auto const& a){ return std::to_string(a); };
std::optional<std::string> const some_zero_as_string{"0"};
std::optional<std::string> const mapped_some_of_zero_as_string = some_zero_as_string
                                                                    | string2int
                                                                    | int2string; // contains "0"
```

There's also an overload for _fmap_ that accepts a member function that has to be **const** and **parameterless** getter function.
So you can do this:

```
struct person {
    int id() const{ return 1; }
};
auto const maybe_id = std::optional{person{}} | &person::id; // contains 1
```

Which calls _id()_ if the std::optional contains a _person_ and wraps it inside a new _std::optional_. Otherwise, in
case the _std::optional_ does not contain a _person_ it simply returns an empty _std::optional_.

It's also possible to use the non-member overload for _fmap_, but at the call site, the user has to wrap the member
function inside a lambda, which adds a little bit of noise to the caller code.

#### bind (>>)

Another useful combinator is _bind_ which allows the composition of functions which by themselves also return values
wrapped in a nullable. Roughly speaking, it's modelling a monad.

Given a nullable _N[A]_ and a function _f: A -> N[B]_, _bind_ uses _f_ to map over _N[A]_, yielding another nullable
_N[B]_.

The main difference if compared to _fmap_ is that if you apply _f_ using _fmap_ you end up with _N[N[B]]_.
Whereas _bind_ knows how it should flatten _N[N[B]]_ into _N[B]_ after applying the mapping function.

Suppose a scenario where you invoke a function that might fail, so you use a nullable to represent such failure.
And then you use the value inside the nullable to invoke another function that might fail as well. So and so forth.
That's precisely a good use-case to make for _bind_.

Example:

```
auto const maybe_int_to_string = [](auto const& a){ return std::optional{std::to_string(a)}; };
std::optional<int> const one{1};
std::optional<std::string> const one_as_string = bind(one, maybe_int_to_string); // contains "1"
std::optional<int> const none{};
std::optional<std::string> const none_as_string = bind(none, maybe_int_to_string); // contains nothing
```

To simplify the act of chaining multiple operations, an infix notation of _bind_ is provided via overloading _operator>>_:

```
auto const maybe_string2int = [](auto const& a){ return std::optional{std::stoi(a)}; };
auto const maybe_int2string = [](auto const& a){ return std::optional{std::to_string(a)}; };
std::optional<std::string> const some_zero_as_string{"0"};
std::optional<std::string> const mapped_some_of_zero_as_string = some_zero_as_string
                                                                    >> maybe_string2int
                                                                    >> maybe_int2string; // contains "0"
```

Similar to _fmap_, there's also an overload for _bind_ that accepts a member function that has to be **const** and
**parameterless** getter function. So you can do this:

```
struct person {
     std::optional<int> id() const{ return 1; }
};
auto const maybe_id = std::optional{person{}} >> &person::id;
```

Which calls _id()_ if the std::optional contains a _person_ already wrapped in an _std::optional_. Otherwise, in
case the _std::optional_ does not contain a _person_ it simply returns an empty _std::optional_.

It's also possible to use the non-member overload for _bind_, but at the call site, the user has to wrap the member
function inside a lambda, which adds a little bit of noise to the caller code.

#### foreach

Another combinator is _foreach_ which allows running a function that does not return any value, so only executing an 
action with the wrapped value as a parameter. Since the action does not return anything, it's only executed because of
its side-effect, like logging a message to the console, saving an entity in the database, etc.

Given a nullable _N[A]_ and a function _f: A -> void_, _foreach_ executes _f_  providing _A_ from _N[A]_ as argument to _f_.
If _N[A]_ is empty, then _foreach_ does nothing.

One use-case for _foreach_ is where you would like to log the wrapped value if any. Otherwise, in case of empty
nullable, you don't want to do anything:

```
foreach(std::optional{person{}}, log);
```

Where _log_ may be:

```
void log(person const&) const;
```

## Requirements

* C++17
* Make
* CMake
* Conan
* Docker

Note that Docker is only required if you want to run the tests inside a container. In that case you just need Make, since
all the other requirements are shipped inside the docker image. Therefore for quick exploration and collaboration, it might
be a good idea.

## Build

The _Makefile_ wraps the commands to download dependencies (Conan), generate the build configuration, build, run the
unit tests, and clear the build folder.

* Compile (by default, it also compiles the unit tests):

```
make
```

By default, it also builds the unit tests, you can disable the behavior by:

```
make BUILD_TESTING=false
```


The build always assumes that the default profile (*profiles/common*) applies to your build. If that's not, then you
can specify your profile by setting _PROFILE_ as:
 
```
make PROFILE=<path_to_your_profile>
```

* To run the unit tests:

```
make test
```

* To clean the _build_ folder:

```
make clean
```

### Run unit tests inside a Docker container

Optionally, it's also possible to run the unit tests inside a Docker container by executing:

```
make env-test
```

## Installing on the system

To install _absent_:

```
sudo make install
```

This will install _absent_ into _${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/absent_ and make it available into CMake local package
repository.

Then, it's possible to import _absent_ into external CMake projects, say in a target _myExample_, by simply adding the
following commands to its _CMakeLists.txt_:

```
find_package(absent REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myExample rvarago::absent)
```

## Packaging via Conan

To generate a package via Conan:

```
make conan-package
```

This will build the package _absent_, run a test package, and then install it in the local Conan cache.


### Deploying to remote

To deploy the package to a remote repository:

```
make conan-upload REMOTE=<REMOTE_NAME>
```

Will deploy the package to the specified remote.
